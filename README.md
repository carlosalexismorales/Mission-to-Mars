# Mission-to-Mars Web App


## Project Overview

The assignment is to build a Web App that will scrape and extract data from several websites for images of Mars’s hemispheres. This is accomplished by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, storing the scraped data on a Mongo database, using a web application to display the data, and altering the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

## Challenge Overview

1. Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
2. Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
3. Add Bootstrap 3 Components
